description: "Marius the Epicurean: his sensations and ideas is a historical and philosophical\
  \ novel by Walter Pater (his only completed full-length fiction), written between\
  \ 1881 and 1884, published in 1885 and set in 161-177 AD, in the Rome of the Antonines.\
  \ It explores the intellectual development of its protagonist, a young Roman of\
  \ integrity, in his pursuit of a congenial religion or philosophy at a time of change\
  \ and uncertainty that Pater likened to his own era. The narration is third-person,\
  \ slanted from Marius's point of view, added to which are various interpolated discourses,\
  \ ranging from adaptations of classical and early Christian writings to Marius’s\
  \ diary and authorial comment.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
